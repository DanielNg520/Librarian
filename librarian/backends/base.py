───────────────────────
The `StorageBackend` Strategy — the seam that makes Telegram just one backend
among durable clouds. Every backend implements the same four operations so the
backup/offload/restore logic never special-cases a provider.

    store(path, content_hash, *, caption=None)
                               → push bytes, return a Locator (where they landed).
                                 `caption` is the send-time message text; the
                                 fast-access tier (Telegram) attaches it, durable
                                 backends ignore it (bytes are the payload there).
    fetch(locator, dest)       → pull bytes back to dest
    verify(locator, hash)      → prove the copy is present (and, where the backend
                                 can, byte-intact)
    exists(locator)            → cheap presence check

VERIFY SEMANTICS — the load-bearing distinction behind the whole HSM design:
  A backend that can cheaply hash its stored object (LocalBackend, RcloneBackend
  via `rclone hashsum`) verifies BYTE INTEGRITY. Telegram cannot return a hash
  without downloading, so its verify() is PRESENCE-ONLY (== exists). This is
  exactly why offload (reclaiming local disk) requires a *durable, hash-verifying*
  backend — never Telegram alone. See DESIGN §4.1 / ADR-0001 D1.

A `Locator` is `(backend, ref)`: `ref` is the backend-specific address string
stored verbatim in `locations.locator`; `backend` is the `locations.backend`
column. Reconstruct one from a DB row to fetch/verify later.

Independent of the suite (no `import core`); see DESIGN §0.
